# Rasterizer-with-OpenGL

A CPU-based rasterizer, with OpenGL as its output.

It's a very huge advancement compared with my work before.

Include:

1 An almost complete structure, from texture of a model to models arranged in a scene. It will have a more clear relationship between all the different classes.

2 with the introduction of OpenGL, we can finally get rid of a static boring image, and find a way to let it move around. Maybe it's kind of real-time rendering I guess, but as more computation is needed, it will soon be lagging.
